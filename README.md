# LAKESIDE SPORTS FESTIVAL üèäüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## *AN REST-API USING NODEJS, POSTGRESQL, VUEJS* 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is to create an application with:
- üë©‚Äçüíª A visual part written in **Javascript** with **VueJs**.
- üíª A database implemented with **PostgreSQL**,
- üíæ A server written in NodeJs, which is the link between the browser and the database, as a **REST-API** and which is also used to send **Javascript** created in **VueJS** to the browser.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This organization allows the browser, through user interactions with the application's graphical interface, to send requests to the API server.
  
Depending on the type of request and its associated data (JSON objects), the API server will execute certain instructions to update the database, and/or extract informations from it to produce new data sent to the browser.
